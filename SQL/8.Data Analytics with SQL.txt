/*
Skewness Calculation:
The code uses the formula for skewness: (Σ((x - μ)^3) / (n * σ^3)), where x is each salary value, μ is the mean of the salaries, σ is the standard deviation of the salaries, and n is the total number of salaries.
It calculates the sum of the cube of the differences between each salary and the average salary, and divides it by the product of the number of salaries and the cube of the standard deviation.
This calculates the skewness value, representing the measure of the asymmetry of the salary distribution.

Kurtosis Calculation:
The code uses the formula for kurtosis: ((Σ((x - μ)^4) / (n * σ^4)) - 3), where x is each salary value, μ is the mean of the salaries, σ is the standard deviation of the salaries, and n is the total number of salaries.
It calculates the sum of the fourth power of the differences between each salary and the average salary, and divides it by the product of the number of salaries and the fourth power of the standard deviation.
It then subtracts 3 from the result, following the convention to subtract 3 from the kurtosis value to get the excess kurtosis.
This calculates the kurtosis value, representing the measure of the heaviness of the tails or the presence of outliers in the salary distribution.
