Python Case Study

Objective:
Analyze the layoffs dataset to understand trends and insights regarding layoffs over a specific period. Focus on cleaning the data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and analyzing trends.

Tasks:

1. Initial Data Loading and Inspection:
   - Load the dataset using pandas.
   - Inspect the first few rows and the data types of each column.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Identify and handle missing values. Decide whether to fill in missing values, drop them, or replace them with a placeholder.
   - Check for duplicate rows and remove them if any.
   - Ensure that dates are in a uniform datetime format.

3. Data Transformation:
   - If there are categorical variables, consider encoding them if necessary for further analysis.
   - Normalize or scale numerical data if required for any analytical models.

4. Data Analysis:
   - Calculate the total number of layoffs.
   - Identify the top 5 companies with the highest number of layoffs.
   - Analyze layoffs trend over time.

5. Visualization:
   - Create a line graph showing the trend of layoffs over time.
   - Generate a bar chart showing the top 5 companies with the most layoffs.

SQL Case Study

Assuming you have the ability to load this CSV into a SQL database, we'll outline SQL tasks to perform similar preprocessing steps and basic analysis.

Objective:
Use SQL queries to preprocess and analyze the layoffs dataset, gaining insights into layoff events.

Preparation:
- Load the `layoffs_data.csv` into a SQL table named `layoffs`.

Tasks:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Identify rows with missing values in critical columns (e.g., company name, layoff date) and decide on an action (delete, default value, etc.).
   - Remove duplicate rows if present.

2. Data Transformation:
   - Ensure date columns are in a consistent date format.
   - For categorical data that might be used in joins or comparisons, ensure consistency in casing (upper/lower).

3. Data Analysis with SQL:
   - Write a query to count the total number of layoffs.
   - Identify the top 5 companies with the highest number of layoffs and order them accordingly.
   - Group layoffs by month and year to see the trend over time.

4. Advanced Analysis (if applicable):
   - Analyze the distribution of layoffs by industry.
   - Assess the impact of layoffs on different regions or locations if such information is available.

Notes:
- For SQL operations, especially transformations and cleaning, you may need to create temporary tables or use subqueries.
- Visualization is not typically a function of SQL; you would export your results for visualization in Python or a tool like Excel.

Deliverables:

- Python script (Jupyter Notebook or Python file) that executes the described tasks using pandas, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.
- SQL script file containing all the SQL queries used to perform the tasks outlined in the SQL case study section.

This case study approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of the dataset from both a programming and database perspective, honing skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and interpretation.
